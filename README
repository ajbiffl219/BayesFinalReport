This folder contains the code files used in this project, as well as the data 
spreadsheet from the Urban Data Catalog


======================================================

Files:


* all_vars.qmd -- "all vars" normal Stan model


* convergence_rstanarm.qmd -- checking convergence of typical rstanarm model
                              used in model_building.qmd


* data_visual.qmd -- scatter plots and correlation plots of data


* data.xlsx -- spreadsheet of city data


* final_means.qmd -- repeating final model with different prior means


* final_predictive.qmd -- replicating data with final model predictions and 
                          my attempt at an effect-ish plot


* final_vars.qmd -- repeating final model with different prior variances


* final.qmd -- final model (and convergence tests)


* greedy.qmd -- greedy model


* modelComparison -- comparing greedy and final models


* model_building.qmd -- notebook for performing greedy search algorithm


* proposal.qmd -- original proposal notebook (includes plots of distributions
                    for all variables)


=================================================================

Note most of these files are configured to save rda files to the same folder, 
but these weren't included as many of them are quite large


Note also that originally, the all vars, greedy and final models were referred 
to as model2, model3, and model4, respectively. I think I've removed all 
references to the old naming system, but some may have made it through.
